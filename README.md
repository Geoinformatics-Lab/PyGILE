# pyGILE - Python Geoinformatics Lab Environment

This repository is a fork of [mmann1123/pyGIS](https://github.com/mmann1123/pyGIS), enhanced with organized setup instructions and Jupyter notebooks for geospatial analysis and GIS operations in Python.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Choose Your Operating System

Navigate to the appropriate folder in `environments/` based on your operating system:

- **Windows Users**: Go to `environments/windows/`
- **Linux Users**: Go to `environments/linux/`
- **macOS Users**: Go to `environments/macos/`

### Step 2: Follow Setup Instructions

Each operating system folder contains specific setup instructions and dependency installation guides:

#### Windows
- Review the `environment_install_windows.pdf` for visual installation guide
- Follow instructions in `windows_install_pygile_base.txt`

#### Linux & macOS
- Follow the README.md file in your respective OS folder
- Use the provided `environment.yaml` file to create the conda environment

### Step 3: Launch Jupyter Lab

After setting up your environment following the OS-specific instructions, launch Jupyter Lab:

```
jupyter lab
```

### Step 4: Explore the Notebooks

Navigate to the `pyGILE_notebooks/` folder within Jupyter Lab to access the available notebooks. These notebooks contain:

- GIS tutorials and examples
- Geospatial data analysis workflows
- Python-based GIS operations
- Interactive mapping examples

## Features

- **Cross-platform support**: Setup instructions for Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **Organized notebooks**: All Jupyter notebooks are centralized in the `pyGILE_notebooks/` folder
- **Comprehensive setup**: Detailed installation guides for each operating system
- **Ready-to-use environment**: Pre-configured conda environments for seamless setup
