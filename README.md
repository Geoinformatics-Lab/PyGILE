# pyGILE - Python GeoInformatics Lab Environment

This repository is a fork of [mmann1123/pyGIS](https://github.com/mmann1123/pyGIS), enhanced with organized setup instructions and Jupyter notebooks for geospatial analysis and GIS operations in Python.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Choose Your Operating System

Navigate to the appropriate folder in `environments/` based on your operating system:

- **Windows Users**: Go to [environments/windows/](environments/windows/)
- **Linux Users**: Go to [environments/linux/](environments/linux/)
- **macOS Users**: Go to [environments/mac/](environments/mac/)

### Step 2: Follow Setup Instructions

Each operating system folder contains specific setup instructions and dependency installation guides:

#### Windows
- Review the [environment_install_windows.pdf](environments/windows/environment_install_windows.pdf) for visual installation guide
- Follow instructions in [windows_install_pygile_base.txt](environments/windows/windows_install_pygile_base.txt)

#### Linux
- Follow the [README.md](environments/linux/README.md) file in the Linux folder
- Use the provided [environment.yaml](environments/linux/environment.yaml) file to create the conda environment

#### macOS
- Follow the [README.md](environments/mac/README.md) file in the macOS folder
- Use the provided [environment.yaml](environments/mac/environment.yaml) file to create the conda environment

### Step 3: Launch Jupyter Lab

After setting up your environment following the OS-specific instructions, launch Jupyter Lab:

```
jupyter lab
```

### Step 4: Explore the Notebooks

Navigate to the [pyGILE_notebooks/](pyGILE_notebooks/) folder within Jupyter Lab to access the available notebooks. These notebooks contain:

- GIS tutorials and examples
- Geospatial data analysis workflows
- Python-based GIS operations
- Interactive mapping examples

## Features

- **Cross-platform support**: Setup instructions for Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **Organized notebooks**: All Jupyter notebooks are centralized in the [pyGILE_notebooks/](pyGILE_notebooks/) folder
- **Comprehensive setup**: Detailed installation guides for each operating system
- **Ready-to-use environment**: Pre-configured conda environments for seamless setup
