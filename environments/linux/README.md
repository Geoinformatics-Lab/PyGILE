## 4. Initialize Miniforge3 Manually

Since you chose "no" during installation, run these commands:

```bash
eval "$(/home/$USER/miniforge3/bin/conda shell.bash hook)"
conda init
source ~/.bashrc

```bash
mamba --version
```

You should see a version number like "mamba 2.1.1"

## 5. Create PyGILE Environment

Navigate to the Linux setup folder:

```bash
cd pyGILE-main/environments/linux

Run the installation script:
```bash
chmod +x install_pygile_linux.sh
./install_pygile_linux.sh
```

## 6. Activate Environment

First, initialize the current bash shell:
```bash
eval "$(mamba shell hook --shell bash)"
```

Then activate:
```bash
mamba activate pygile_base
```

Your prompt should now show (pygile_base) at the beginning of each line.

## 7. Test Installation

```bash
python -c 'import geopandas, rasterio, geowombat, jupyter; print("All packages working!")'
```

You should see: "All packages working!"

**SUCCESS!**
