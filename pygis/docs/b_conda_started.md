# Setting up Python for Spatial on Mac, Windows, and Linux
Spatial analysis requires a pretty broad set of python modules and with it, comes a lot of dependencies. And to be honest, the only thing Python doesn't do well with, is dependencies. Luckily we have a few tricks up our sleeves to help you get to work fast. 

## Docker for Spatial Python - GDAL Included
Docker allows us to essentially package and share operating systems with specific modifications. Importantly for us this includes libraries and dependencies that are difficult to install otherwise (I'm looking at you GDAL). Before we start you should familiarize yourself with the basic concepts behind Docker, please read the following: [a simple intro to Docker concepts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/container-docker-introduction/docker-defined)

To get this done we will be accessing [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/), which allows coders like us to store their Docker images. We will be downloading an image of the Linux operating system (Ubuntu, which is "debian-based"), that already has GDAL built for us. Once we "pull" a copy of the image of this operating system we will open it as "a container". This "container" is a running instance of the "image" that we can run our applications on, and customize for our use case.  Read some more on ["images" vs "containers" etc here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/container-docker-introduction/docker-containers-images-registries).

### Install Docker
Follow the instructions for installing Docker on your system, take your time, and make sure you understand what you are doing before you do it!


````{tab} Mac
```python
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/
```
````
````{tab} Windows
```python
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/
```
````
````{tab} Linux
```python
# click on your platform
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server
```
````

There are two ways we can do this, the [easy way](theeasyway), or the much more [detailed way](thedetailedway). Choose your poison.

### Pulling a Docker Image Ready for GIS
Now we are going to get an Ubuntu image running that already has everything installed and ready to use. We are going to pull the lastest build of our image from [my docker hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/mmann1123/gw_pygis).

First open a **terminal** or **powershell** in windows... yes powershell not terminal, type the following:

````{tab} Mac
```
# download the image
docker pull mmann1123/gw_pygis

# list your images 
docker images -a 

# you should see mmann1123/gw_pygis
```
````
````{tab} Windows
```
# IN POWERSHELL TERMINAL 

# download the image
docker pull mmann1123/gw_pygis

# list your images 
docker images -a 

# you should see mmann1123/gw_pygis
```
````
````{tab} Linux
```
# download the image
docker pull mmann1123/gw_pygis

# list your images 
sudo docker images -a 

# you should see mmann1123/gw_pygis
```
````


Now we can access python through jupyter notebooks ([read about jupyter notebooks here](https://coderefinery.github.io/jupyter/motivation/)). Jupyter is probably the easiest way to start your coding. 


```{note}
You can mount a volume from your normal operating system to your linux container using the `-v` option of `docker run`. In the above case you can connect your `/Users/<user_name>/Documents` folder into the `/home/<user_name>` folder of your container by running `docker run -v /Users/<user_name>/Documents:/home/<user_name>` (mac), `docker run -v //c/User/<user>/Documents:/home/<user_name>` (windows), or `docker run -v /home/<user_name>/Documents:/home/<user_name>` (linux). To access your documents folder from within you container just `cd` into it e.g. `cd /home/<user_name>`. 
```
 
To do this we are going to attach a local volume with `-v`, open a port with `-p` and run mmann1123/gw_pygis, once inside of the runnning linux computer we will launch jupyter notebook and set an ip address to access it using `-ip`, and we will allow administrative privileges using `--allow-root`.  After executing the code we simply need to open up the URL displayed in response.

 

````{tab} Mac
```
# Or if browser is  present
docker run -v /Users/<user_name>/path_to_folder_you_want_access_to:/home/<user_name>  -it -p 8888:8888 mmann1123/gw_pygis
jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0  --allow-root

# or if the jupyter notebooks doesn't launch automatically
docker run -v /Users/<user_name>/path_to_folder_you_want_access_to:/home/<user_name>  -it -p 8888:8888 mmann1123/gw_pygis
jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser --allow-root
# THEN control click on URL printed to the bottom of terminal
```
````
````{tab} Windows
```
# Or if browser is  present
docker run -v //c/User/<user_name>/path_to_folder_you_want_access_to:/home/<user_name>  -it -p 8888:8888 mmann1123/gw_pygis
jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0  --allow-root

# or if the jupyter notebooks doesn't launch automatically
docker run -v //c/User/<user_name>/path_to_folder_you_want_access_to:/home/<user_name>  -it -p 8888:8888 mmann1123/gw_pygis
jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser --allow-root
# THEN control click on URL printed to the bottom of terminal
```
````

````{tab} Linux
```
# Iff browser is  present
sudo docker run -v /home/<user_name>/path_to_folder_you_want_access_to:/home/<user_name>  -it -p 8888:8888 mmann1123/gw_pygis
jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0  --allow-root

# or if the jupyter notebooks doesn't launch automatically
sudo docker run -v /home/<user_name>/path_to_folder_you_want_access_to:/home/<user_name>  -it -p 8888:8888 mmann1123/gw_pygis
jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser --allow-root
# THEN control click on URL printed to the bottom of terminal
```
````
Every time you want to run pygis you are going to `run` the docker container called `mmann1123/gw_pygis`. 

```{warning}
**When working in your container make sure to store all your data outside of the container!** This is kind of like a school computer, where every time you log out, all the changes you made are deleted. 

You can save your data in your linked volume which in these examples can be found by typing `cd /home/<user_name>` while inside your container. The connected folder was defined with the `-v /home/<user_name>/path_to_folder_you_want_access_to:/home/<user_name>` option with docker run.
```

To make this a little easier you can create an executable script on your desktop to run it when you want. 

````{tab} Mac Bash
```
# move to your desktop
cd ~/Desktop/

# write a shell script called run_pygis
# between the ''s put whatever bash code you want
echo '
sudo docker run -v /Users/<user_name>/path_to_folder_you_want_access_to:/home/<user_name>  -it -p 8888:8888 mmann1123/gw_pygis
jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0  --allow-root
' > run_pygis.sh

# allow it to be executable
chmod 755 run_pygis.sh  
```
````
````{tab} Windows
```
# Not sure yet!
```
````

````{tab} Linux
```
# move to your desktop
cd ~/Desktop/

# write a shell script called run_pygis
# between the ''s put whatever bash code you want
echo '
sudo docker run -v /home/<user_name>/path_to_folder_you_want_access_to:/home/<user_name>  -it -p 8888:8888 mmann1123/gw_pygis
jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0  --allow-root
' > run_pygis.sh

# allow it to be executable
chmod +x run_pygis.sh  
```
````

Now that we have an executable file we need to execute this, on linux at least, the only one I can test on, we need to execute it from the command line. But its pretty easy.

To execute our run_geowombat.sh script we need to navigate to the Desktop in your local terminal, then execute the file:

````{tab} Mac Bash
```
# move to your desktop
cd ~/Desktop/

# execute it
./run_pygis.sh
```
````
````{tab} Windows
```
# Not sure yet!
```
````

````{tab} Linux
```
# move to your desktop
cd ~/Desktop/

# execute it
./run_pygis.sh
```
````

When you're done with your work inside the container, and double checked that your data is saved locally - not on the container - you can type `exit` in the terminal window to exit your geowombat container.

### Pull and Run a Linux Image with GDAL
Now we are going to get an Ubuntu image running that already has GDAL installed. We are going to pull the lastest build of our image from [OSGEO's docker hub page](https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/tree/master/gdal/docker).

First open a terminal or powershell, type the following:

````{tab} Mac
```
# download the image
docker pull osgeo/gdal:ubuntu-full-latest

# list your images 
docker images -a 

# run osgeo/gdal image, but link my volume /your_folder_to_share_with_image:/location_on_container_to_access_it
# here I am linking my <user_name> home folder to the containers home folder
# important: update the <user_name> portion with your windows user name
docker run -v /Users/<user_name>/path_to_folder_you_want_access_to:/home/<user_name>  -it osgeo/gdal:ubuntu-full-latest
```
````
````{tab} Windows
```
# download the image
docker pull osgeo/gdal:ubuntu-full-latest

# list your images 
docker images -a 

# run osgeo/gdal image, but link my volume /your_folder_to_share_with_image:/location_on_container_to_access_it
# here I am linking my <user_name> home folder to the containers home folder
# important: update the <user_name> portion with your windows user name
docker run -v //c/User/Users/<user_name>/path_to_folder_you_want_access_to:/home/<user_name>  -it osgeo/gdal:ubuntu-full-latest
```
````
````{tab} Linux
```
# download the image
sudo docker pull osgeo/gdal:ubuntu-full-latest

# list your images 
sudo docker images -a 

# Run osgeo/gdal image, but link my volume /your_folder_to_share_with_image:/location_on_container_to_access_it
# here I am linking my home folder to the containers home folder
sudo docker run -v /home/<user_name>/path_to_folder_you_want_access_to:/home/<user_name>  -it osgeo/gdal:ubuntu-full-latest
```
````

```{note}
You can mount a volume from your normal operating system to your linux container using the `-v` option of `docker run`. In the above case you can connect your `C:/User/<user>/Documents` folder into the `/home/<user_name>` folder of your container by running `docker run -v //c/User/<user>/Documents:/home/<user_name>`. To access your documents folder from within you container just `cd` into it e.g. `cd /home/<user_name>`. 
```

Your command prompt in the terminal window should now say something funny like `root@b0c5ab799195:/# `. You are now INSIDE your running docker container, which is running Ubuntu linux. 

Just to demonstrate this is really linux, let's ask the system what OS is running:
````{tab} Linux Container
```
uname
```
Should return `Linux`
````
We will need to update/upgrade the OS, install pip and a few other applications we need, pip install geowombat, and a few more python dependancies for it. We will then exit the container and save a named copy of it. 

````{tab} Linux Container
```
# update Ubuntu
apt update -y 
apt upgrade -y

# install pip and a few other things 
apt install python3-pip git gdal-bin libgdal-dev libspatialindex-dev   -y 

# install geowombat and with it geopandas, rasterio etc
pip install git+https://github.com/jgrss/geowombat

# install a few more dependancies for geowombat, including jupyter notebooks
pip install cython numpy retry requests opencv-python notebook

#test and exit - this should print the version of geowombat installed
python -c "import geowombat as gw;print(gw.__version__)"

# Install any other modules you want via pip

```
````
Now we need to exit the container and go back to your local computer command line. 

````{tab} Linux Container
```
exit
```
````
Note that we are now in your boring old terminal/shell, we exited Ubuntu. 

We now need to create a named image that includes geowombat etc. Without doing this, the next time we start the osgeo/gdal image nothing will have been saved. 

````{tab} Mac 
```
# list all available containers
docker ps -a

# find the "CONTAINER ID" of the container that was just exited seconds ago, 
# and replace the example ID used below

# commit changes to new named image (replace 12 digit container id from one listed above)
docker commit 9c3f33afcff9 pygis

# list all available images, look for pygis.
docker images
```
````
````{tab} Windows
```
# list all available containers
docker ps -a

# find the "CONTAINER ID" of the container that was just exited seconds ago, 
# and replace the example ID used below

# commit changes to new named image
docker commit 9c3f33afcff9 pygis

# list all available images, look for pygis.
docker images
```
````
````{tab} Linux 
```
# list all available containers
sudo docker ps -a

# find the "CONTAINER ID" of the container that was just exited seconds ago, 
# and replace the example ID used below

# commit changes to new named image
sudo docker commit 9c3f33afcff9 pygis

# list all available images, look for pygis.
sudo docker images

# if you want to stop typing "sudo" before docker run the following, and log out of your computer
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
```` 

Ok, now we are getting somewhere. We have created a new image called "pygis" that should have everything we need to get this done! Now the problem is how to access it?!

```{note} 
Keep in mind if you want to make changes to the 'pygis' image you will need to first run it via the command line, make your changes, and then 'commit' or save another named version (ideally with a different name)
```

### Access your spatial python image 
There are two ways to access this 1) through the command-line and 2) through Jupyter Notebooks. 

Let's start with command line only access. Note that this is almost exactly how we ran the osgeo/gdal image, except we replaced its name with geowombat. *Don't forget to replace `<user_name>` with your user name!*

````{tab} Mac
```
docker run -v /Users/<user_name>/path_to_folder_you_want_access_to:/home/<user_name>  -it pygis
python
```
````
````{tab} Windows
```
docker run -v //c/Users/<user_name>/path_to_folder_you_want_access_to:/home/<user_name>  -it pygis
python
```
````
````{tab} Linux
```
sudo docker run -v /home/<user_name>/path_to_folder_you_want_access_to:/home/<user_name>  -it pygis
python
```
````
Now you are at the python command prompt, start coding!


Alternatively, we can access python through jupyter notebooks ([read about jupyter notebooks here](https://coderefinery.github.io/jupyter/motivation/)). Jupyter is probably the easiest way to start your coding. 

To do this we are going to 

````{tab} Mac
```
# Or if browser is  present
docker run -v /Users/<user_name>/path_to_folder_you_want_access_to:/home/<user_name>  -it -p 8888:8888 pygis
jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0  --allow-root

# or if the jupyter notebooks doesn't launch automatically
docker run -v /Users/<user_name>/path_to_folder_you_want_access_to:/home/<user_name>  -it -p 8888:8888 pygis
jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser --allow-root
# THEN control click on URL printed to the bottom of terminal
```
````
````{tab} Windows
```
# Or if browser is  present
docker run -v //c/User/<user_name>/path_to_folder_you_want_access_to:/home/<user_name>  -it -p 8888:8888 pygis
jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0  --allow-root

# or if the jupyter notebooks doesn't launch automatically
docker run -v //c/User/<user_name>/path_to_folder_you_want_access_to:/home/<user_name>  -it -p 8888:8888 pygis
jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser --allow-root
# THEN control click on URL printed to the bottom of terminal
```
````

````{tab} Linux
```
# Iff browser is  present
sudo docker run -v /home/<user_name>/path_to_folder_you_want_access_to:/home/<user_name>  -it -p 8888:8888 pygis
jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0  --allow-root

# or if the jupyter notebooks doesn't launch automatically
sudo docker run -v /home/<user_name>/path_to_folder_you_want_access_to:/home/<user_name>  -it -p 8888:8888 pygis
jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser --allow-root
# THEN control click on URL printed to the bottom of terminal
```
````
Every time you want to run pygis you are going to `run` the docker container called `pygis`. 

```{warning}
**When working in your container make sure to store all your data outside of the container!** This is kind of like a school computer, where every time you log out, all the changes you made are deleted. 

You can save your data in your linked volume which in these examples can be found by typing `cd /home/<user_name>` while inside your container. The connected folder was defined with the `-v /home/<user_name>/path_to_folder_you_want_access_to:/home/<user_name>` option with docker run.
```

To make this a little easier you can create an executable script on your desktop to run it when you want. 

````{tab} Mac Bash
```
# move to your desktop
cd ~/Desktop/

# write a shell script called run_pygis
# between the ''s put whatever bash code you want
echo '
docker run -v /Users/<user_name>/path_to_folder_you_want_access_to:/home/<user_name>  -it -p 8888:8888 pygis
jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0  --allow-root
' > run_pygis.sh

# allow it to be executable
chmod 755 run_pygis.sh  
```
````
````{tab} Windows
```
# Not sure yet!
```
````

````{tab} Linux
```
# move to your desktop
cd ~/Desktop/

# write a shell script called run_pygis
# between the ''s put whatever bash code you want
echo '
docker run -v /home/<user_name>/path_to_folder_you_want_access_to:/home/<user_name>  -it -p 8888:8888 pygis
jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0  --allow-root
' > run_pygis.sh

# allow it to be executable
chmod +x run_pygis.sh  
```
````

Now that we have an executable file we need to execute this, on linux at least, the only one I can test on, we need to execute it from the command line. But its pretty easy.

To execute our run_geowombat.sh script we need to navigate to the Desktop, then execute the file:

````{tab} Mac Bash
```
# move to your desktop
cd ~/Desktop/

# execute it
./run_pygis.sh
```
````
````{tab} Windows
```
# Not sure yet!
```
````

````{tab} Linux
```
# move to your desktop
cd ~/Desktop/

# execute it
./run_pygis.sh
```
````

When you're done with your work inside the container, and double checked that your data is saved locally - not on the container - you can type `exit` in the terminal window to exit your geowombat container.
