    "# An Introductory Example\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We\\'re now ready to start learning the Python language itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we will write and then pick apart small Python\n",
    "programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to introduce you to basic Python syntax and data\n",
    "structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deeper concepts will be covered in later lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, data structures are a way of organizing and storing data to perform operations efficiently. In Python, data structures come in various types, such as lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, and more. Each data structure has its own characteristics and use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, lists are mutable sequences of elements, and you can add, remove, or modify elements easily. Dictionaries, on the other hand, use key-value pairs to store data, making it easy to retrieve values based on their corresponding keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this course, we'll use data structures to represent and manipulate data in various Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Indentation in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, indentation is crucial for defining the structure of the code. Unlike many other programming languages that use braces ({}) to delimit code blocks, Python uses indentation. The number of spaces or tabs at the beginning of a line determines which code block the line belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a `for` loop or `if` statement, the indented block of code represents what will be executed if the condition is met. Indentation must be consistent and usually follows the standard of four spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have an understanding of data structures and indentation, let's move on to writing some Python code examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Task: Plotting a White Noise Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to simulate and plot the white noise process\n",
    "$\\epsilon_0, \\epsilon_1, \\ldots, \\epsilon_T$, where each draw\n",
    "$\\epsilon_t$ is independent standard normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we want to generate figures that look something like\n",
    "this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/python_by_example/test_program_1_updated.png\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(Here $t$ is on the horizontal axis and $\\epsilon_t$ is on the vertical\n",
    "axis.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We\\'ll do this in several different ways, each time learning something\n",
    "more about Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "We run the following command first, which helps ensure that plots appear\n",
    "in the notebook if you run it on your own machine."
