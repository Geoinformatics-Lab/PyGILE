    "that you can find by exploring)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modal Editing\n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing to understand about the Jupyter notebook is that it uses\n",
    "a *modal* editing system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the effect of typing at the keyboard **depends on which\n",
    "mode you are in**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two modes are\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Edit mode\n",
    "    -   Indicated by a green border around one cell, plus a blinking cursor\n",
    "    -   Whatever you type appears as is in that cell\n",
    "2.  Command mode\n",
    "    -   The green border is replaced by a grey (or grey and blue) border\n",
    "    -   Keystrokes are interpreted as commands --- for example, typing `b` adds a new cell below the current one\n",
    "\n",
    "To switch to\n",
    "-   command mode from edit mode, hit the `Esc` key or `Ctrl-M`\n",
    "-   edit mode from command mode, hit `Enter` or click in a cell\n",
    "\n",
    "The modal behavior of the Jupyter notebook is very efficient when you\n",
    "get used to it.\n",

    "#### Inserting Unicode (e.g., Greek Letters)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports [unicode](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html),\n",

    "Google Colab is a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment provided by Google. It allows you to write and execute Python code, similar to Jupyter Notebooks, but without the need for local installations. Google Colab provides free access to computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs, which can be beneficial for resource-intensive tasks.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Open a web browser and navigate to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n",
    "2. Sign in to your Google account or create one if you don't have it already.\n",

    "### Creating a New Colab Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are signed in, you can create a new Colab notebook:\n",

    "### Running Code in Colab\n",
