    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving windows or filters are often used in raster analysis. For example, they can be used to obtain the maximum value within a certain neighborhood, to smooth out values, or detect holes or edges (i.e., where pixel values that are near each other change abruptly).\n",
    "\n",
    "These moving windows can also be called filters or kernels. They can be of many different sizes and shapes (the most common is 3-cell-by-3-cell rectangular window) and can have different or the same values for each cell. The center of the filter can be called the target cell or the center pixel, and the surrounding cells are referred to as the neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The filter passes through all *non-edge* cells in the raster. During each pass of the filter, the center cell is updated based on the cells adjacent to it. In the `3x3` filter example, the center cell is updated by the eight cells that neighbor it. The filter then pulls the values from the neighboring cells and the center pixel itself, performs a calculation based on the filter values (e.g., calculates the mean), reports that resulting value back to the identical location of the original pixel, moves to the next pixel, and repeats the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../_static/img/raster_sliding_window.jpg\n",
    ":name: Sliding Window Operations\n",
    "Sliding window operations move across an entire raster.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The filter values can essentially be any number--they can be the same across the filter or be all different. The values determine how the output is calculated (equation below assuming a `3x3` filter for nine cells total in the kernel):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    X_{w} = \\sum_{i=1}^{9}X_{i}k_{i}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*where:*\n",
    "  $X_{i}$ = raster cell value\n",
    "\n",
    "  $k_{i}$ = kernel cell value\n",
    "\n",
    "  $i$ = index of cells in the nine kernel cell values\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The values also determine *what* is calculated. For example, setting all filter values to `1` will result in the filter outputting the sum of all raster pixel values within the filter. Setting all filter values to `1/9` for a `3x3` filter will result in the filter outputting the average of all raster pixel values within the filter.\n",

    "\n",
    "```{attention}\n",
    "With window operations, the edge pixels will generally be cut out from the output because those edge pixels do not have neighboring pixels all around it. As window operations generally require a pixel to be surrounded on all four sides, we cannot perform calculations on these edge pixels. The pixels that constitute the \"edge\" depends on the shape of the kernel. For example, a `3x3` kernel only requires 1 neighboring pixel in each direction, so only the outer ring of pixels will be cut out from the output. A `5x5` kernel requires 2 neighboring pixels in each direction, so the two outer rings of pixels will be cut out.\n",

    "## Window operations with rasterio\n",
    "\n",
    "The most intuitive way to perform window operations in Python is to use a `for` loop. With this method, we would iterate through each non-edge pixel, obtain the surrounding pixel values and the center pixel value, perform some sort of calculation, report that resulting value back to the identical location of the original pixel, move to the next pixel, and repeat the process. Iterating through each pixel, however, has the potential to be extremely time and computationally intensive (there could be many, many pixels).\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate this limitation, instead of using a `for` loop, we can get each neighbor value simultaneously for all non-edge pixels. Another way to think of it is that instead of using a `for` loop to iterate through each pixel to get neighboring values, we can iterate through each kernel position to get the neighboring value corresponding to a certain kernel position for all non-edge pixels at once. This is what a vectorized sliding window does.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vectorized sliding window is grounded in the concept that each position in the kernel has a certain relative position or offset (e.g., one pixel to the left) from the center pixel of the kernel. This method works because each pixel in a raster is in essence a neighbor to at least one other pixel. The vectorized sliding window simply offsets itself within the raster array extent so that each pixel that falls within the vectorized sliding window is the neighbor of the same relative position (e.g., one pixel to the left) to its center pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "A vectorized sliding window is created for each position in the kernel. The vectorized sliding window of a certain kernel position is applied over the raster and obtains--all at once--the neighboring pixel value corresponding to that kernel position for all non-edge pixels. The size of vectorized sliding window is dependent on the size of the raster and kernel but will always fall between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more conceptual information on vectorized sliding windows and how they compare to iterating through each pixel, see [this article](https://opensourceoptions.com/blog/vectorize-moving-window-grid-operations-on-numpy-arrays/).\n",
